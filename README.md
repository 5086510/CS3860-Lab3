# Overview

This project implements a 2D Cellular Automaton, specifically Conway's Game of Life, using GNU Smalltalk. The simulation reads an initial board configuration from a file and progresses through generations based on predefined rules.

File Structure

main.st: The main execution file that initializes and runs the simulation.

Board.st: Defines the Board class, which represents the board and automaton logic.

Cell.st: Defines the Cell class, representing individual cells with alive and dead states.

config.txt: Example configuration file specifying the initial board state.
